								<h3><a></a></h3>
								<span><small>November 09, 2018 </small> | <small>By: Nicholas Wyrick</small></span>
								<p class="first-letra">On <strong>11/09/2018</strong>  I met a person that I never met before. We sat and talked for maybe 2 hours. 
								I saw myself in him. But as I listened, I realized that I made a choice that he should have made a long time ago. 
								But I also realized that I would be in his shoes if I didn't make that choice a long time ago.<p>
								 
								<a>He was homeless. He had no job. He had kids. He had 2 different baby mommas.</a>
								<p>
								See when he was 16, he had lots of money and like we both said money attracts the wrong people.
								And at that time, he wanted a family. She didn't want a family she only wanted the kids for the money and his money. 
								Same thing happened after he kept making the same mistake with his other baby mommas. <br>
								
								We both where intelligent. We both had made mistakes. And we both thought the same. 
								I gave him the advice he needed and he gave me the advice I needed to help me succeed with my family. 
								Note, that this man is 10 years older than me. He knows what to do and how to make it in life. 
								But he had to take a stand and leave love behind and fix himself. And one day love will come to him again. <br>
								
								For me he said <a><u>"a dog with a leash with either run or stay if you let it go. 
								If the dog loves you it will stay. If the dog doesn't love you it will run away." </u></a>
                                <p>
                                He told me his son was 18 and he’s about to graduate high school. 
								He said the greatest memory of all is seeing the birth of his son. 
								He wants to be able to see his son graduate and talk to him face to face and man to man. 
								He wants to have that father son bond. <br><a>Sadly that may never happen...</a>	
                                <p>
                                I told him this.... <a><u>" A child grows to realize the lies from the truth. 
								And as they get older, they find out who the real parent is and who they can always come to and rely on."</u></a>
                                <p> 
                                See I didn't start dating till I was 20 years old. 
								I fell in love but knew it wasn't getting me anywhere in life. 
								So, I left that relationship to better myself and my future. 
								I started working. I made good money and I became successful. 
								But then I hit a bump in the road and fell into a spiral. 
								And when you hit rock bottom you find out who has always been there for you.  
								I met the mother of my kids. She saw through my mistakes and helped me correct all my mistakes. 
								And I thank her so much for that. She is a great mother and a great person.
								<p>
                                Like he said before about the dog on the leash. <a><u>"She didn't run. She stays because she loves you"</u></a>
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"For him I pray that he takes my advice like I took his. 
									You cannot keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. You have to stop before it's too late."
								</blockquote>
								<p><strong>"A person like me will run away from problems and then come back with the answers to solve them."</strong>
								<p><strong>"I have to stay active or I will get too bored too easily. I have to be on the move. I have to be open. I have to get out."
								</strong><p/>
								
								<strong>"A person can be so intelligent but it can be his own down fall. He can use it to do good or wrong."</strong>
								<p><strong></strong>

									<li>- It's best to make connections. It’s also best to leave negative energy alone. <p>
									<li>- You learn the most from just watching and doing less talking. <p>
									<li>- Try to talk less and do more listening</li>
